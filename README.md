# MySQL JDBC Connector

This project packages MySQL JDBC driver into a single JAR that could be used in Stratio modules.

Some dependencies have been relocated to avoid conflicts with Spark/Crossdata dependencies, but all of them are included in the JAR.

## Artifacts

Releases can be found in [Stratio Nexus](http://niquel.stratio.com/#browse/search/maven=attributes.maven2.groupId%3Dcom.stratio.mysql).
